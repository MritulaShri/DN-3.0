Concept of Recursion:

Definition: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. The recursive approach simplifies complex problems by breaking them down into more manageable subproblems. Each recursive call works on a smaller portion of the problem until a base case is reached, at which point the function returns a result that gets combined as the recursive calls unwind.

Advantages of Recursion:

Simplicity: Recursion often leads to simpler and more readable code for problems that have a naturally recursive structure, such as tree traversals, factorials, and Fibonacci sequences.
Ease of Implementation: Certain problems, especially those that involve repeated subdivisions, can be easier to implement recursively than iteratively.

Disadvantages of Recursion:

Performance: Recursive solutions can be less efficient than iterative ones due to the overhead of multiple function calls.
Memory Usage: Recursion can lead to excessive memory usage because each function call is added to the call stack, potentially leading to stack overflow for deep recursions.
Optimization Challenges: Recursive solutions may require additional strategies, like memoization or dynamic programming, to optimize and avoid redundant calculations.

Creating a Method to Calculate Future Value Using a Recursive Approach:

Assume a simple scenario where the future value is calculated based on a fixed annual growth rate over a number of years. The recursive method will predict the future value based on the current value and the growth rate.

Formula:
Future Value (FV) = Present Value (PV) * (1 + growth rate) ^ number of years

Recursive Implementation Strategy:

The base case will be when the number of years is 0, where the future value equals the present value.
The recursive case will calculate the future value for the current year and then call itself for the next year.

Time Complexity Comparison:

Linear Search: O(n)
Linear search iterates through the entire array, making it slower, especially for large datasets.
Binary Search: O(log n)
Binary search divides the array in half with each iteration, making it significantly faster than linear search for large, sorted datasets.
Suitability for the Platform:

Linear Search:

Suitable for small datasets or unsorted data where sorting overhead is not justifiable.
Itâ€™s also useful when the dataset is dynamic, frequently changing, or when the cost of maintaining a sorted list is too high.

Binary Search:

More suitable for large datasets where the data is already sorted or can be sorted efficiently.
Provides much faster search times, which is crucial for an e-commerce platform where users expect quick search results.

Time Complexity of Operations:

Add Employee: O(1)

Adding an employee is fast because it involves placing the employee at the end of the array and incrementing the counter.
Search Employee: O(n)

Searching requires traversing the array until the employee is found, resulting in linear time complexity in the worst case.
Traverse Employees: O(n)

Traversing the array requires visiting each element, so the time complexity is linear.
Delete Employee: O(n)

Deleting an employee involves searching for the employee and then shifting elements to fill the gap, both of which contribute to O(n) complexity.

Limitations of Arrays:

Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size, meaning you need to allocate enough memory at the start, and this can lead to wasted space or lack of space.

Inefficient Insertions/Deletions: Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the array requires shifting elements, which is time-consuming.

Lack of Flexibility: Unlike dynamic data structures like linked lists, arrays do not adapt well to frequent changes in size.

When to Use Arrays:

Small or Fixed-Size Data: Arrays are suitable when you know the number of elements in advance, and the data size is manageable.

Fast Access Required: When you need quick access to elements using an index, arrays are ideal.

Memory Efficiency: If memory usage is a concern and you need a compact data structure, arrays can be beneficial.

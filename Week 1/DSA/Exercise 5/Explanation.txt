Singly Linked List:

Description: A singly linked list is a data structure where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The list starts with a head node, and the last node points to null, indicating the end of the list.

Advantages:

Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically, making them ideal for situations where the number of elements is unpredictable.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Insertions and deletions are more efficient than arrays, especially for operations at the beginning or middle of the list, since there is no need to shift elements.

Disadvantages:

No Direct Access: Accessing an element in a linked list requires traversing from the head, resulting in O(n) time complexity for search operations.
Extra Memory: Each node requires additional memory to store the pointer to the next node.

Doubly Linked List:

Description: A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but each node contains two references: one to the next node and one to the previous node. This allows traversal in both directions.

Advantages:

Bidirectional Traversal: Nodes can be traversed in both forward and backward directions.
Efficient Deletions: Deleting a node is more efficient because you have direct access to the previous node.
Disadvantages:

Increased Memory Usage: Additional memory is required to store the extra pointer for the previous node.
More Complex Implementation: The need to maintain two pointers in each node adds complexity to the implementation.

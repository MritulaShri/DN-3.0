Analysis:
Time Complexity of Operations:

Add Product: O(1) on average due to the hash-based storage in HashMap.
Update Product: O(1) on average since updating an entry in HashMap involves a hash lookup.
Delete Product: O(1) on average, similar to the update operation.

Optimization:

Collision Handling: Ensure that the hash function minimizes collisions in the HashMap. Javaâ€™s HashMap handles this internally, but understanding its behavior can help optimize performance further.

Load Factor: Adjust the load factor of HashMap if necessary to balance space and time efficiency.

Data Validation: Implement validation checks to handle invalid operations gracefully and ensure data consistency.
